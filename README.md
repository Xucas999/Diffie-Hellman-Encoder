# Diffie-Hellman-Encoder

# This project aims to create a chatroom that allows two users to message each other
# The messages are encrypted by using the Diffie-Hellman Encryption to create a shared secret and then using AES to encrypt the messages

# Completed Work:
#   DH_encoder.py provides algorithms to calulate shared secrets
#   client.py and server.py allows two terminals to share a secret

# Future Work
#   Enable terminals to send encrypted messages
#   Allow two local machines to send encrypted messages
#   Allow any two machines to send encrypted messages
#   Create a GUI
#   Add a encryption efficiency slider that allows users to change the size of the prime numbers
#   Include a tab that displays all relevant encryption information (keys, shared values, etc)
